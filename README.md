# (2016) Description - 

The original idea of this project was to gather information about different workout exercises and which muscle groups they worked, and then to automatically create a workout regimen based on the user's goals and also their progress/soreness. 

A large file of scraped data from bodybuilding.com has most of this information. 

This project hasn't been worked on or updated since 2016. 

I'm uploading today in 2021 for archiving.
